## Version Formatting

The version of the mod determines every update released.  
For every Minecraft version, it will reset back to 0.0.1-v-tag.  
For example, `1.5.14-1.21-beta`. It will be formatted in this way:  
`x.y.z-v-tag`.

| Syntax | Description          |  
|:------:|----------------------|  
|  `x`   | Major updates        |  
|  `y`   | Minor updates        |  
|  `z`   | Even minor updates   |  
|  `v`   | Minecraft version    |  
| `tag`  | beta, alpha, release |
